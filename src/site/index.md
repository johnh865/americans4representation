Making a Real Difference 
=========================

We’re a group dedicated to maximizing your political potential. Americans have the power to make a difference. The way to achieve power is to get organized with a simple process: 

1. **Vote in every election, every time.**
2. **Vote in every primary, every time.**
3. **Vote in every local, state, and federal election, every time.**
4. **Politics is a team sport. Get organized.**
5. **Use the *division of labor* to maximize your impact.**
6. **Participate even if you don’t have time to participate, by delegating your wishes out to friends, leaders, and those you trust.** 
7. **Build an army of local voters that politicians can’t afford to ignore.** 
8. **Lobby our politicians and make them an offer they cannot refuse - Do what we tell them to do, or get elected out of office.**

If you want to maximize your political voice, join the Americans for Representation. We are dedicated to representing the true democratic will of Americans by following the rules above. We’re a nonpartisan organization, so everyone is invited!
