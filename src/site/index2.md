## Americans For Representation

We know something is wrong with government. The Economist calls our government a [“flawed democracy”](https://www.eiu.com/topic/democracy-index). According to [Gallup](https://news.gallup.com/opinion/polling-matters/211892/americans-budget-cuts.aspx), “Only 28% of Americans have a positive overall view of the US federal government… That was the lowest rating for any business or industry sector.” Mechanisms such as money in politics, the electoral college, and [gerrymandering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerrymandering) have corrupted our democracy. But what can we do to fix America? 

# Achieving True Grassroots Advocacy

*The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result.* Concerned Americans go to the polls. Concerned Americans donate some money to a political campaign or advocacy group. Yet no substantive change ever seems to happen. Instead of failing over and over again, perhaps it's time for a new approach. 

## The New Approach

The Americans For Representation propose a new approach to empower all Americans:

1. Organize people to **strategically vote in unison at all local, state, and federal elections** in order to maximize political power. 

2. Send **true representatives** to speak to politicians and extract tit-for-tat exchanges in favor of our desired policy, using our collective votes and donations as leverage.

3. Advocate for **election reforms** in order to promote political equality and minimize all barriers to participation - advocating for reforms such as score voting, ranked choice voting, and participatory vouchers.

4. Create a new organization that is **trustable and accountable** to its members by using cooperative, democratic elections to ensure the organization's leadership represents its members. 

This is the same strategy special interests use to lobby our government. It’s time for ordinary Americans to harness this power. However in order to create this power, we need a new political organization that Americans can trust. We need a *cooperatively owned political group.*

## Cooperative Ownership

[Cooperative ownership](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperative) means that you and other members legally own the AFR rather than some private benefactor. Members elect, hire, and fire the leadership at will. Electoral power ensures that your interests will be advocated for rather than the interests of the leadership. Membership will also be open to all citizens who wish to participate. With cooperative ownership, you will drive the organization’s goals from the bottom up. 

## Maximizing Power and Minimizing Effort

The primary objective of the AFR Cooperative is to **maximize voter power, and minimize time and effort**. The AFR understands that most people don't have the time to fully participate in politics. People don't have the time to trudge through local meetings and join local interest groups. People don't have the time to research advocacy groups, or review their records to understand their efficacy. Most people do not have time to learn about and research dozens of political offices and candidates. As a mental shortcut, many people merely vote straight party on the assumption that the party has already chosen a decent candidate - an assumption that is oftentimes wrong. 

Yet societies have already solved all of these problems through a process called **the division of labor**. We hire plumbers and electricians to work on our house. We hire engineers to design our buildings and bridges. Why don't we hire people to help sort out the complexities of politics? Well, we already do, but they're only affordable to the wealthiest of Americans, and they are called *lobbyists*. 

The AFR aims to provide America with their own personal lobbyists - in other words, their own **true representatives** - people that can better express our political beliefs better than our officially elected politicians. True representatives will conduct political research on your behalf. True representatives will contact and negotiate with politicians on your behalf. True representatives can be fired immediately when they betray your trust. True representatives can *be anybody that you deem trustworthy* - your friends, your family, your heroes - whoever you can convince to participate. And using a process called [*delegative democracy*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delegative_democracy), true representatives can accumulate money and power sufficiently to influence politicians towards our demands. 

In other words, the AFR shall: 

- **Provide true democratic representation.** Through democratic ownership, AFR members will elect representative leadership - leaders that can be trusted - leaders with a much shorter leash than the politicians in Washington.

- **Become a lobbying firm.** The AFR will fight fire-with-fire and arm Americans with the same tools that special interests have used to corrupt our government.

- **Provide members actionable news & information** on issues and strategic voting in order to maximize voter influence.

- **Nominate our members as candidates** in Republican and Democratic primaries.

The AFR will not exclusively support one party. The AFR will choose its support strategically with the goal of maximizing our members’ political power and influence.

# Reforming Government

## Disrupting the Two Party System

Americans are dissatisfied with both parties and must resort to picking the lesser of two evils for every election. Gerrymandering, convoluted party primaries, and the exorbitant cost of political campaigning all work to disempower the working and professional class. The AFR will work to eliminate these barriers to participation. 

The two-party system has also produced decades of political stalemate, polarization and voter dissatisfaction. Many political scientists believe that this stalemate is a [consequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duverger%27s_law) of our winner-takes-all election system. However, solutions have already been developed to fix these problems.

## Electoral Reform

Political scientists have devised many innovative ideas that could be used to repair our democracy and advance 3rd party participation. These include:

- **[Proportional representation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportional_representation)** - Representatives are elected to congress based on vote proportion rather than arbitrary district boundaries.

- **[Score based voting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Score_voting)** - an alternative voting system where voters score each candidate, and the candidate with the greatest score wins.

- **[Delegative “liquid” democracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delegative_democracy)** - A mode of governance where voters can choose to delegate out their votes to representatives. Or, voters can choose to directly vote. In other words, you can choose whether you want to directly participate or you want to delegate out your authority.


The AFR seeks to create the best possible American democracy. The AFR shall test and validate potential reforms on its own internal election system. After experimentation, validation, and approval by our members, the AFR will then lobby government to implement these new reforms.  

## Creating a New Consensus

Americans are not so different from one another. Yet mass media and partisan talking heads pit father against son, mother against daughter, and neighbor against neighbor.

The AFR seeks to construct a new political forum where people can come together to rationally discuss our interests and make the necessary compromises to make a better society. At the very least, we all need to reach a new understanding and trust of each other, even if we cannot agree to the details of policy and ideology. 

Only with a new consensus can we can finally enact the necessary reforms that our current politicians cannot.  

# A Call for Membership 

We want liberals. We want conservatives. We want libertarians. We want socialists. We want the selfish and the selfless. We want to empower everyone as a rising tide lifts all boats. We want your **active participation**. If you think America can do better, please [join our group](/contact)!
