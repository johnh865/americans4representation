## Some Frequency Asked Questions

### *This scheme seems unlikely to work because it's never been tried.*

Actually there have been many similar groups historically. For example, the political machines of the 1900's and the labor unions of the 20th century. The difference between the AFR and those groups is open membership and full Democratic accountability of the leadership. 

Moreover, repeatedly doing the same thing over and over again without achieving your goals is insanity. It's time for people to try new political strategy when the old methods have failed again and again. The special interest groups, the lobbyists, and the politics of today have gotten us to the highest levels of government dissatisfaction. We need a new way of organization people together, and if it's not the AFR, then it's going to have to be something else new and different. 


### How can you get a bunch of different people to agree on anything???

This group is founded on the hope that yes, Democracy can work. The alternative is the world we live in now, where big business seize more and more power, and corporate media drives "outrage culture" for the sake of increasing advertising revenue. It is truly a dark day if our group cannot function and Democracy fails. If Democracy fails on the small scale, how could Democracy hope to function in the nation-wide scale? I believe before we fully surrender our power to big business and multinational conglomerates, we need to try democracy first. 

So how can we get alleged "political opponents" to agree with each other? Well, we Americans are not political operatives or pundits. We're neighbors and friends of each other. We're not opponents. We're not enemies. 

Moreover, lots of research suggests the same. Most Americans tend not to be "ideologically motivated". Instead we are more "Group Identity" motivated.
