## Books

* deKieffer, Donald. **The Citizens Guide to Lobbying Congress**. - Book on how to become a lobbyist. 
* Richan, Willard. **Lobbying for Social Change** - Another book on how to be an effective lobbyist. 
  - Some interesting quotes:
    - "Personal commitment to a cause is one of the most underestimated resources in advocacy"
    - "Lobbying is not a solo activity. Make allies. This may require balancing your agenda against items in someone else's.
* Mason, Lilliana. **Uncivil Agreement: How Politics Became Our Identity** - I haven't read this one yet, but here Lilliana argues that politics is driven less about actual policy and ideology but rather about "identity".
